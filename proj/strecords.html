<h1>Student Records Information System</h1>
<p>The manual processing of student records has consistently caused headaches 
  for administrators, teaching staff, and students. Records are lost, data retrieval 
  is time consuming and data is just not kept up to date.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, good information systems cost a lot of money and still end up 
  requiring local training components. Purchased information systems do not readily 
  attach to the local administrative practises and would soon be counter productive 
  or ignored.</p>
<p>The simple proposal is to develop a local package that is built for the intricacies 
  of schools in the Pacific.</p>
<p>An initial review of an optimal approach to the development components is to 
  target the components that will ensure use of the system, while at the same 
  time improve the product.</p>
<p>Phase 1 - Bursar Information System</p>
<p>Phase 2 - Roll Call Information System</p>
<p>Phase 3 - Grade Analysis System</p>
<p>Phase 4 - Student Enquiry System</p>
<p>Phase 5 - Staff Entry System</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Client ~ Server.</h2>
<p>Developing a Client / Server system will allow non-technical staff to perform 
  tasks allocated to them, without having to worry about the maintenance and distribution 
  of the information (for example, they don't have to worry about securing the 
  data files, backups, etc.)</p>
<p>Accordingly, the client-server mechanism will allow the distribution of thin 
  clients with limited access privileges. </p>
<p>For example: we can create data entry forms as web-pages which means any terminal 
  with a web browser can become a data entry station, we no longer need to install 
  a database program for each client. Standard database authentication and data-entry 
  validation can still be performed.</p>
<p>Likewise, aggregate queries can be pre-built links (although calculated on 
  a per-click item)</p>
