<h1>TimeTabling</h1>
<p>There are a plethora of timetabling packages available on the market, and no-one 
  is interested in buying one. By using some of the simpler algorithms (eg. backtracking) 
  we can probably develop a small timetabling package that can be readily used 
  at schools in Tonga.</p>
<p>The TimeTabling project can then expand to include some of the other features 
  in full packages, such as scheduling examinations, staff load analysis/allocation.</p>
