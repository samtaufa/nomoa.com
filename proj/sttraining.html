<h1>Staff Training</h1>
<p>One serious, and continuing problem, with development of Computer Studies and 
  computing in Tonga has been the oversight and disregard for existing staff. 
  The school systems stand to gain significantly when their staff are empowered 
  by the knowledge available through IT and the empowerment for improved quality 
  service.</p>
<p>The following are a list of proposed minimal skills for effective, independent 
  computing by staff members. (listed in no particular order)</p>
<ul>
  <li> File Management 
  <li>Creating Notes 
  <li>Incorporating graphics into notes 
  <li>Creating Examination Papers 
  <li>Collating Records 
  <li>Analysing Records 
  <li>Data Security practises (backing up, anti-virus, passwords)</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is increased skills to lead to increase usage to lead to increased 
  efficiencies and increased facilities for students.</p>
<h2>Technical Staff Skills</h2>
<p>With the increased dependence on IT, the technical staff will need to recognise 
  the need for their edification in matters such as: (again in no particular order)</p>

<ul>
<li >1<sup>st</sup> Level Operational Skills
  <ol type=a>
    <li >Administer Accounts (create, modify, delete) 
      <li >Administer Groups (create, modify, delete) 
      <li >Access Control Lists (use, change)

  <ol type=a>
    <li >Develop scripts for automated administration</li>

</ul>
<p>Note that the above list of skills are for the smooth, optimal function of 
  the computer facilities and in no way describes the needs of the courses operated 
  by the schools. </p>
