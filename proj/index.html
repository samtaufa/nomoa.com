<h1>Tonga's SchoolNET Project Proposal</h1>
<h2>Introduction.</h2>
<p>The developments in computer education, access at various schools in Tonga 
  provides a prime environment for developing Information Systems that we propose 
  will contribute to the services available to administrators, staff, and students.</p>
<p>The following are a phases towards information dissemination.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#stafftraining"> Staff Training</a></li>
  <li><a href="#earchive">Electronic Archiving</a></li>
  <li><a href="#strecords">Student Records</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ttable">Time Tabling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The proposal is for interested parties to get together, select project leaders, 
  and pursue the creation of solutions beneficial to the individual school systems, 
  and students.</p>
<p>The above noted projects articulate the objectives towards improvements and 
  sustainability of student services through the empowerment with information 
  skills.</p>
<h2>Brief of Project Items</h2>
<p><a name="stafftraining"></a>Staff Training.</p>
<p>Without digging into references, is a significant cause of failure for the 
  introduction of things including technology. The spread of technology tools 
  at schools such as Liahona, QSC, St. Andrews, Tonga H/C, Tupou H/C, has been 
  held back not by the archaic equipment but the fear of staff members and lack 
  of defining skills. For any success to be long term, staff aclimatisation and 
  integration with the use of technologies is a necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="sttraining.html"><img src="../mmedia/more.gif" width="43" height="18" border="0" alt="More Info"></a></p>
<p><a name="earchive"></a>Electronic Archiving (EA)</p>
<p>EA is now feasible for a number of education systems. The proposal is to design 
  a consistent, transferable, system for archiving data such that it can be reused.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="earchiving.html"><img src="../mmedia/more.gif" width="43" height="18" border="0" alt="More Info"></a></p>
<p><a name="strecords"></a>Student Records </p>
<p>A consistent problem in each school year. The issue is problematic for the 
  clerical staff assessing fee payments, administrators reviewing attendance and 
  parental records, staff members reviewing student progress, and students wishing 
  to know their progress. The proposal is to develop an Information System that 
  can scale to incorporate many of the needed data items now used by various pressure 
  groups. &nbsp;<a href="strecords.html"><img src="../mmedia/more.gif" width="43" height="18" border="0" alt="More Info"></a></p>
<p><a name="ttabling"></a>Time Tabling </p>
<p>An annual problem for administrators, a significant problem for students locked 
  out of desirable classes due to limited time tabling facilities. Primarily a 
  computing/algorithm exercise the proposal is to develop a single system for 
  all involved schools that can be enhanced by the requirements of different school 
  system.</p>
<p>We seek an elegant, effective solution, that can be implemented across different 
  environments and systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="ttabling.html"><img src="../mmedia/more.gif" width="43" height="18" border="0" alt="More Info"></a></p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>Although it may not seem appropriate, we should consider strongly the involvement 
  of the school community in the design and development of the system. Not only 
  is this necessary to the acceptance of any developed system, but will also be 
  necessary as we must transition maintenance of the system design to the school 
  community.</p>
<p>The above is only a short look at what is needed at the schools in Tonga. Development 
  members may choose a different list and prioritisation.</p>
<p class="url">An electronic copy of this information will be maintained on <a href="http://nomoa.com/proj/">http://nomoa.com/proj/</a> 
  and a mailing list will be put together and interested parties can be included.</p>
