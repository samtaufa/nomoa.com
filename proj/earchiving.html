<h1>Electronic Archiving</h1>
<p>The reams of Gestetner Stencil papers are a testament to how much reprints 
  are part of school systems.</p>
<p>The concept of Electronic Archiving is to archive electronic documents for 
  re-use, distribution. The design will have to factor what are existing (approachable) 
  technologies and the mechanism to installing and ensuring use.</p>
<p>Discussions on this proposal will need to review what are the basic needs for 
  consistency in document creation and archiving methodologies.</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li> storage hierarchy / storage mechanism</li>
  <li>storage format</li>
  <li>security policies</li>
  <li>backup policies</li>
  <li>naming conventions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storage Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The hierarchy of document storage are categorised by intended audience while 
  keywords (standardised by the design group) can be included in documents to 
  maximise search / retrieval.</p>
<p>Storage Location: //storage/examinations/english/form5/[midyear|finals|topical]</p>
<p>contains documents relevant to the specified topic/course/level/section. Each 
  document placed into this location can also include a &quot;Keywords&quot; section 
  where related &quot;section&quot; information can be entered. Microsoft Word 
  (for example) has a document properties component of the document where 'keywords' 
  can be entered.</p>
<p>Files stored on Microsoft Windows NTFS 5.0 each have additional properties 
  maintained by the File System that includes: Summary Data (including keywords)</p>
<h3> Storage Format</h3>
<p>Although it would seem appropriate to use a database, the use of an extra layer 
  of work to store and retrieve the documents is likely to be an impediment to 
  the use of the system. The quickest way to useage (as opposed to implementation) 
  is to use a monitored hierarchical file system and store the documents in their 
  original format.</p>
<p>Allow addition (file creation) to the system, but control deletion and modification. 
  Staff can then check-out a document, make modifications and resubmit to the 
  archive, but they cannot accidently wipe an existing document.</p>
<p>A simplified search utility can be developed to search everything or by specified 
  keywords/categories. The utility can list the available documents, and attempt 
  to launch them if the application exists on the client.</p>
<h3>Security Policies</h3>
<p>The archives will require a number of access privileges, but at minimum should 
  have a public access policy to maximise the useage of the data store.</p>
<p>For example, once examination papers have been sat, all students should have 
  read access to the papers.</p>
<h3>Backup Policies</h3>
<p>This is less likely to be pushed to conformity but a discussion should outline 
  for participating schools a safe sequence of data backup procedures.</p>
<p>Considering the potential value of the system, it will be important to improve 
  system integrity and up-time.</p>
<h3>Naming Convention</h3>
<p>As many documents of a similar nature will be created a standard naming convention 
  should increase the useability of the system. (An area where creativity is likely 
  to be counter-productive)</p>
