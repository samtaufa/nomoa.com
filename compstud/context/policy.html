            Computing Policy
         </h1>
         <p >
            Queen Salote College is responsible for securing its network and
            computing systems in a reasonable and economically feasible degree
            against unauthorized access and/or abuse, while making them
            accessible for authorized and legitimate users.&nbsp; This
            responsibility includes informing users of expected standards of
            conduct and the punitive measures for not adhering to them.&nbsp; Any attempt to violate the provisions
            of this policy will result in disciplinary action in the form of
            temporary revocation of user accounts, regardless of the success or
            failure of the attempt. Permanent revocations can result from
            disciplinary actions taken by a panel judiciary board called upon
            to investigate network abuses.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>
            
         </p>
         <p >
            The users of the network are responsible for respecting and
            adhering to school regulations, local and international laws.&nbsp; Any attempt to break those regulations
            and laws through the use of the network may result in litigation
            against the offender by the proper authorities.&nbsp; If such an event
            should occur, this organization will fully comply with the
            authorities to provide any information necessary for the litigation
            process.<br>
            <br>
            
         </p>
         <p >
            Use of computer facilities is acceptance of the terms of this
            Computing Policy.
