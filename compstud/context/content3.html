</B><H2>How we use these materials?</H2>
<B><P>These materials are used internally as reference material for staff course notes and for student reference.  The materials are available on our school Intranet, allowing us to readily correct errors and allowing students access to course materials which the school cannot afford to purchase nor print for each student.  </P>
<P>In practise, no teacher is allowed to reproduce the notes verbatim, but uses these notes as a stepping stone for personal understanding before their own rewrites, interpretations for students.</P>

<P>In practise, students are initially hesitant to print out the notes, fearing some form of retribution, and when they are shown that it is acceptable and encouraged, students gladly print notes from which assignments are set.  For our purposes this also provides practise for students in navigating computer environments (the browser) and configuring as well as printing documents.</P>
</B><H2>How can you use these materials?</H2>
<B><P>We would be honoured if you should choose to use these materials in your studies.  Our request is for some minor recognition of our efforts and especial assistance in determining the accuracy, efficacy of the materials.</P>

</B><H2>Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.01?</H2>
<B><P><A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html"><IMG align="left" SRC="../../mmedia/getacrobat.gif" width=88 height=31 border=0 alt="Get Adobe Acrobat Here"></A>Many of the materials for these pages have been developed for Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.01.  Adobe Acrobat was chosen to control the layout of documents which includes tables and graphics.  We found student printouts of HTML equivalent pages took up to twice the number of pages as Acrobat files.  Acrobat files were smaller in size and required less maintenance although we have set it for A4 paper size.</P>
<P>Course materials are developed in a mix of packages including Adobe Acrobat Distiller, Adobe PageMaker, Allaire HomeSite 3.0/4.0, Microsoft Photo Editor, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Word.</P>
</B><H2>The Catch, The Missing Bits?</H2>
<B>
<P>Application Specific Instructions we have left out in most parts because the books available on the market can be very very good.</P>
<P>There are no missing bits.  To gauge feedback on the usefulness of these pages please keep us informed on your use of these pages.  We are very interested in your feedback and especially if it deals with potential issues of copyright infringements and accuracy.</P>
</B>

<H2>Disclaimers ?</H2>
<B><P>Where things are wrong, they are probably all our fault and unrelated to the materials from whence we originally sourced the information.  Take a look at it and if it doesn't work for you, our apologies.  If it doesn't work, please tell us or create your own pages.</P>
