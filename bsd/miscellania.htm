<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Miscellaneous Stuff I haven't got a category for, but need to jot down so I 
  can write up on it. </p>
<p>Actually, these are things of general interest to myself, and have learned 
  about while watching the misc@ mailing list. I'm jotting down those things that 
  I think I will eventually look at so as to have a centralised placed to look 
  for them (in a compacted fashion.)</p>
<p>Most of this information has been derived from misc@openbsd.org and other mailing 
  lists.</p>
<h2><a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Tools</h2>
<p>These are but some of the tools that I've come across as being discussed and 
  potentially of need of some documentation.</p>
<h3><a name="bandwidth"></a>Bandwidth Limiter</h3>
 
<p>Bandwidth management is everyone's concern, even the large corporate with plenty of money to burn. The first good news is that OpenBSD 3.3 integrates the queue management system ALTQ into the base install.  You get a secure OS with bandwidth limiting facilities, just coool. To learn more about it, follow the PF FAQ information on http://www.openbsd.org and subscribe to the pf mailing list.</p>
  
<p>The following tools have been mentioned on various discussions   as valuable tools (to some) for managing their bandwidth utilisation by clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.csl.sony.co.jp/person/kjc/programs.html" class="anchBlue">http://www.csl.sony.co.jp/person/kjc/programs.html</a><br>
  AltQ (Alternate Queueing) seems to be the most mentioned tool. </p>
<p>AltQ became part of the post 3.0 source tree and is likely to gain more documentation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.squid-cache.org" class="anchBlue">http://www.squid-cache.org</a></p>
<p>According to the squid mailing lists, the <i><a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-19.html#ss19.8" class="anchBlue">delay 
  pools</a></i> are good for time periods such as an hour, but not optimal for 
  people who wish to configure the bandwidth constraints over longer periods such 
  as per day or per week.</p>
<h3><a name="antivirus"></a>Anti-Virus Solutions</h3>
<p>The next level of security, apart from the Network OS, is to secure malicious 
  communications or resource transfers. The following Anti-Virus products have 
  variants that are either Native under the BSDs or can be executed in the Linux 
  compability layer. Be warned that some have reported installation problems with 
  the way some of the anti-virus programs install themselves.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you browse the mailing list archives for MTA's 
  such as exim and postfix who are bound to have various discussions relating 
  to anti-virus software.</p>
<p>Our first anti-virus installation is successfully using RAV Antivirus, largely 
  because it has native OpenBSD support. You have to license the product but we 
  have been satisfied with its current performance. It works as a mail filter 
  and the executables also function as scanners on standard files.</p>

<h3><a name="netmonitor"></a>Network Usage/Monitoring Tools</h3>
<p>For some service providers it may be important to keep track of actual external 
  traffic generated by users. The following tools have been discussed as relevant 
  for this type of auditing, monitoring task.</p>
<p>mrtg, cricket (in ports)</p>
<p>IP Meter <a href="http://www.ipmeter.com">http://www.ipmeter.com</a> </p>
<p>IP Audit <a href="http://ipaudit.sourceforge.net/">http://ipaudit.sourceforge.net/ 
  </a></p>
<h3><a name="drivemirroring"></a>Drive Mirroring</h3>
<p>Drive mirroring is useful when you want the ability to dump an active/functional 
  system onto another disk, such that you can quickly recreate the exact same 
  system onto the same machine or on to similar other systems.</p>
<p>We have been effectively using Norton Ghost for our Windows platforms and it 
  was interesting to note mail discussions on other solutions, including open 
  source.</p>
<p>A fault with using Norton Ghost for imaging OpenBSD is that NG does not recognise 
  the FFS, or UFS file system. This does not have an effect on NG being able to 
  image and recreate OpenBSD partitions, but it does significantly increase the 
  image size as NG cannot use any significant compression algorithms.</p>
<p>One significant advantage of NG for Windows is NG can resize the image partition 
  to fit within changes in the disk sizes targetted for the image. In this way, 
  you can use the same image on multiple size drives, so long as the contents 
  in the image can fit on the target drives.</p>
<p>g4u (ghost for unix) <a href="http://rfhs8012.fh-regensburg.de/%7Efeyrer/g4u" class="anchBlue">http://rfhs8012.fh-regensburg.de/~feyrer/g4u</a></p>
<p>is based on NetBSD (?)</p>
<p>Other recommendations is to script dumps (dd) of the hard-drive to an ftp server</p>
<p>There are of course further reference information in the FAQ on duplicating 
  file systems. Likewise Ben Goren has further information on his site: <a href="http://openbsd.trumpetpower.com/faq/faq10.html#DupFS" class="anchBlue">http://openbsd.trumpetpower.com/faq/faq10.html#DupFS</a></p>

<h3><a name="cat5"></a>CAT5 Cabling</h3>
<p>Steve DeRose's guide to CAT5 computer network wiring <a href="http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/wiring/" class="anchBlue">http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/wiring/</a></p>
<p>Why mention this ? Because I've been hit often enough with problems in cabling, 
  it's bad enough when its my own fault for messing my home network cabling.</p>
<p>I've even gone to sites that were supposedly professionally cabled and it didn't 
  take long to figure that their network problem was related to not being in spec.</p>
<p>I used to blame the drivers or OS when I had network faults, especially &quot;time-outs&quot; 
  on the network cards. Now, I make sure I include checking the cabling as an 
  early part of the diagnosis process.</p>
