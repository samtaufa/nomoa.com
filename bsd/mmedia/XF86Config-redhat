#
# XF86Config (XFree86 4.0.2) file for Toshiba Satellite Pro 4600.
#
# This is a Trident CyberBlade XP graphics card with 16 MByte memory.
# SVGA graphics is supported up to 1600x1200 @ 85 Hz.
# The LCD is a 15 inch 1024x768 TFT.
#
# The card is not recognised by the trident driver, and the vga driver
# gives only 320x200 pixels.  So the generic vesa driver is used, which
# supports up to 1280x1024.
#
# This file is bascially created with xf86config for an unsupported VGA card.
# However, then the Driver was changed from "vga" to "vesa", the DefaultDepth
# from 8 bpp to 16 bpp, and the Modes list reduced to "1024x768" only.
#
# If you add a "1280x1024" mode at the end of the Modes line,
# you will have a 640x480 viewport on that size of screen, scrolled by
# mouse movement.  If you put that mode in front of "1024x768" you will
# have a 1024x768 viewport on a 1280x1024 screen, but cannot scroll to
# the right or bottom edge.
#
# 24 bpp and 32 bpp do not work, I suspect the card does not support
# 24 bpp and the vesa driver does not support more than 24 bpp.
